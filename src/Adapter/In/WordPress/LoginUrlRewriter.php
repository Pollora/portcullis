 *   new-user emails, the password-protected post form and the expired-session
 *   modal, go through one of them with the `login` or `login_post` scheme.
 *
 * - `wp_redirect` catches URL *consumption*. `wp-login.php` redirects to
 *   relative locations in several branches, `wp_safe_redirect( 'wp-login.php?checkemail=confirm' )`
 *   after a password reset request being the one users hit first. A relative
 *   location would be resolved by the browser against the secret slug and yield
