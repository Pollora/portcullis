/**
 * Routes the request: secret slug to the login screen, stock endpoints to a 404.
 *
 * The work is split across two hooks, and the split is dictated by the order of
 * `wp-settings.php`:
 *
 * - `plugins_loaded` (priority 1) is the earliest point where `is_user_logged_in()`
 *   is usable — `pluggable.php` is loaded a few lines above — and it is still
 *   early enough to rewrite the request environment before any plugin reads it.
 *   Crucially it also runs *before* `wp-admin/admin.php` reaches `auth_redirect()`,
 *   which would otherwise redirect anonymous visitors to the login URL and hand
 *   them the secret slug.
 *
 * - `wp_loaded` (last priority) is where the response is produced. Rendering
 *   requires `$wp`, `$wp_query` and `$wp_rewrite`, which only exist after
 *   `plugins_loaded`, and running *last* is what reproduces the native ordering:
 *   `wp-blog-header.php` calls `wp()` once `wp_loaded` has fully completed, and
 *   `wp-login.php` renders once `wp-load.php` has returned. Anything earlier
 *   would skip the plugins that register on `wp_loaded` — on a Sage theme, for
 *   instance, Acorn would not have bound its `template_include` filter yet and
 *   the 404 template would fatal instead of rendering.
 *
 * Nothing is emitted in between, so a request that is going to be refused still
 * goes through `init` looking like an ordinary — and unremarkable — front-end hit.
