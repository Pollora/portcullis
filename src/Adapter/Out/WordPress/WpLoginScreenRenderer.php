     * 1. `$pagenow` is set to `wp-login.php`, so third-party code that keys off
     *    it — brute-force protection, two-factor providers — recognises the
     *    screen it is supposed to act on.
     *
     * 2. `REQUEST_URI` is rewritten to the *canonical* form of the slug, with no
     *    trailing slash. This is not cosmetic: the password reset screen scopes
     *    its `wp-resetpass-*` cookie on `current( explode( '?', REQUEST_URI ) )`,
     *    while the form it renders posts to the URL produced by
     *    {@see RewriteLoginUrl}. Should a
     *    visitor reach `/secret-slug/` while the form posts to `/secret-slug`,
     *    the cookie would not be sent back and the reset would fail with an
     *    "expired link" error that is close to impossible to diagnose.
