/**
 * Recognises the convenience URLs WordPress maps onto its stock entry points.
 *
 * Beyond the real scripts on disk, core answers a handful of virtual paths —
 * `/login`, `/wp-login.php`, `/admin`, `/dashboard` — by redirecting them, in
 * `wp_redirect_admin_locations()`. The login half of that redirect targets
 * `wp_login_url()`, which this package has rewritten to the secret slug: a
 * single request to `/wp-login.php` therefore answers with the secret in a
 * `Location` header, defeating the whole point of hiding it.
 *
 * These paths are not `DefaultEndpoint` in the sense of
 * {@see RequestContextPort::defaultEndpoint()}, which classifies the executing
 * script; they are aliases resolved much later, once the request is already
 * known to be a 404. Hence a separate decision, kept here as a pure function of
 * its inputs so it can be exhaustively tested without WordPress.
